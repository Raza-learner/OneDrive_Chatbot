File: Opponent Pressing Structure — Match Analysis
Opponent: City United U-18
Match Date: Yesterday
Competition: League

Overall Pressing Style:
- High press in 4-3-3 shape when ball is with our center-backs.
- Mid-block 4-1-4-1 when ball is in our half but outside final third.
- Triggers: poor back-pass, slow lateral pass, receiving player with back to goal.

Build-Up Disruption:
- They forced play wide by screening our 6 (CDM).
- Wingers pressed our full-backs aggressively when ball went wide.
- Center forward curved pressing runs to block pass back across the back line.

Pressing Triggers (examples):
1) Back-pass from full-back to center-back.
2) Slow square pass between center-backs.
3) Goalkeeper receiving under pressure.

Weaknesses Observed:
- When we played one-touch into the 8/10 behind their first line, they were late to shift.
- Large gaps between their back line and midfield when press was broken.
- Full-backs overcommitted, leaving space in channels.

Key Clips (timecodes as examples):
- Clip 1: 05:32 — high press wins ball near our box.
- Clip 2: 22:15 — we beat the press with wall pass into 8.
- Clip 3: 61:47 — long diagonal to weak-side winger behind their full-back.

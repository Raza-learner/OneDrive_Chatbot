USE CASE 3 — Opponent Scouting & Match Prep

File: Team X Scouting Report
Team: Team X
Matches Analyzed: Last 5 league matches

1) Base Formation
- Nominal formation: 4-3-3 in possession.
- Out of possession: often drops into 4-1-4-1 mid-block.

2) Formation by Match (Last 5)
- Match 1: 4-3-3 (high press first 30 minutes, then mid-block).
- Match 2: 4-2-3-1 (10 switched to second striker in final 20 minutes).
- Match 3: 4-3-3 (inverted wingers, full-backs very high).
- Match 4: 4-4-2 diamond when chasing result, starting from 4-3-3.
- Match 5: 4-3-3 (compact, narrow midfield three to block central channels).

3) Key Patterns
- Build-up: Prefer short build from GK, use 6 dropping between CBs.
- Chance creation: Overloads on right side, cut-backs to penalty spot.
- Pressing: Triggers on backwards passes and poor touches by opposition CBs.

4) Weaknesses
- Vulnerable to quick switches to opposite flank when FB presses high.
- CBs struggle with balls played into space behind when line is high.
